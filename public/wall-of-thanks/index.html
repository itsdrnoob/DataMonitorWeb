                Thank you for your interest in <b>Data Monitor</b>! Our app relies on the support of our users to continue development and we are grateful for every donation we receive. To show our appreciation, we have created a Wall of Thanks page to recognize our donors.
            </p>

            <p class="subtitle">‚Ä¢ What is Wall of Thanks?</p>
            <p class="content-text">
                The Wall of Thanks is a special page within our app that displays the list of users who have generously contributed to our development efforts. It's not a virtual space, but it's definitely a virtual hug from us to you.
            </p>

            <p class="subtitle">‚Ä¢ How can I be included on the Wall of Thanks?</p>
            <p class="content-text">
                With the Google play variant, when you donate through the app, you'll have the option to submit your name and a photo. We'll take care of the rest and add you to the Wall of Thanks.<br>
                If you're donating through other means (PayPal, Crypto etc.), just send us an <a href="mailto:bitroid.dev@gmail.com?subject=Wall%20of%20Thanks">email</a> and we'll take care of it.<br><br>
                One thing to note - if you've already donated and is not on the Wall of Thanks or would like to remove yourself from the Wall of Thanks for any reason, just send us an <a href="mailto:bitroid.dev@gmail.com?subject=Wall%20of%20Thanks">email</a> and we'll take care of it right away.
            </p>

            <p class="subtitle">‚Ä¢ Why should I donate?</p>
            <p class="content-text">
                We're not going to beg you or bribe you with a puppy üê∂ (even though puppies are really cute). We'll just say that your donation helps us keep the app free and continue to improve it. And, of course, it means a lot to us to have your support, and every donation, no matter how small, makes a difference.
            </p>

            <p class="subtitle">‚Ä¢ Where can I donate?</p>
            <p class="content-text">
                We've made the process as simple as possible. Just navigate to <strong>Settings > Donate</strong> and you'll be greeted with a list of donations options.<br>
                If you're using the Play store variant of the app, you can donate from the app itself. Pretty easy right?<br>
                You can also view all donation options <a href="https://github.com/itsdrnoob/DataMonitor#support" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>

            <p class="content-text-bottom">
                Thanks for being a part of our community and for considering supporting us. We can't wait to add you to our Wall of Thanks and give you a virtual high-five!
            </p>
